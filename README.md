Consumer reviews of Amazon products

I created this repository so that I could use a data set, "Consumer reviews of Amazon products" downloaded from the website data.world.

Over 1500 reviews of Amazon products like Amazon Kindle, Amazon Fire, etc.

About this Data:

This is a sample data set of consumer reviews for Amazon products like the Kindle, the Fire, and others. The data set contains over 1,500 reviews for these products and includes review text, rating, and basic product information.

A similar data set was used to analyze reviews for Amazon products: https://datafiniti.co/amazon-fire-stick-juggernaut/

The URL for this data set can be found at: https://data.world/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products. 
(The file could not be assessed through either R script using downloader::download or RCurl::getURL)

I intially wanted to work with data on Vegetarian restaurants - uploaded on the same website - but github did not allow me to upload the data since it exceed the 25mb limit (I thought it was supposed to be 100MB)
